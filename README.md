#In this project we learn how to use Git.

#Step 1) git init <folderNameForLocalRepo>
#Step 2) Create any file like README.md
#Step 3) git status
#Step 4) git add <filename or .>
#Step 5) git commit -m "<message to commit to local directory>"
#Step 6) Type "git remote -v" to check if this local directory is linked to some remote directory on github or not.
#Step 7) Create a remote repository on Github where you want to link your local repo
#Step 8) To link remote repo to local, type "git remote add origin <link of repo>". origin is basically the name of remote reference. We can change this as per convenience but default is used in general.
#Step 9) To put data on remote reference from local, type "git push -u origin master". The -u parameter is used to create a tracking relation between what is locally my master and my origin.
